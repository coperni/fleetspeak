# Frontend mode Sandboxes

We have created a number of sandboxes using Docker Compose that set up environments to test out Fleetspeakâ€™s frontend mode features and show sample configurations.

These can be used to learn about Fleetspeak's frontend mode options and how to model your own configurations.
The sandboxes use a containerised version of the Fleetspeak demo setup described in the [guide documentation page](https://github.com/google/fleetspeak/blob/master/docs/guide.md). 

Before you begin you will need to install the sandbox environment.

## Setup the sandbox environment
- [Install Docker](#install-docker)
- [Install docker compose](#install-docker-compose)
- [Install Git](#install-git)
- [Clone the Fleetspeak repository](#clone-the-fleetspeak-repository)

## The following sandboxes are available
- [Direct mTLS mode](./sandboxes/direct-mtls-mode)
    - end-to-end mTLS
    - Fleetspeak's original design
- [Passthrough mode](./sandboxes/passthrough-mode)
    - TCP proxy passthrough
- [HTTPS header mode](./sandboxes/https-header-mode)
    - L7 proxy terminates mTLS connection
    - Proxy passes client side certificate and checksum via HTTP headers
    - TLS connection from proxy to Fleetspeak
- [Cleartext header mode(./sandboxes/cleartext-header-mode)
     - L7 proxy terminates mTLS connection
    - Proxy passes client side certificate and checksum via HTTP headers
    - Cleartext connection from proxy to Fleetspeak

## Setup instructions

### Install docker
Ensure that you have a recent versions of ```docker``` installed.

You will need a minimum version of ```19.03.0+```.

Version ```20.10``` is well tested, and has the benefit of included ```compose```.

The user account running the examples will need to have permission to use Docker on your system.

Full instructions for installing Docker can be found on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  


### Install docker compose
The examples use [Docker compose configuration version 3.8](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-38).

You will need to a fairly recent version of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  

### Install Git
The Fleetspeak project repository is managed using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

You can [find instructions for installing Git on various operating systems here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  


### Clone the Fleetspeak repository
If you have not cloned the Fleetspeak repository already, clone it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/google/fleetspeak
```
